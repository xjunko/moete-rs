# moete, the next version   |  ![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/rust-%23000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=rust&logoColor=white) ![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord-%235865F2.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=discord&logoColor=white)
a (hopefully) better and improved version of Moete, written in the Rust Programming Language.

## why
- memory constraints (current version is written in python and we only have 1gb ram at best)
- to learn rust (i've been putting this off for years now)
- improve performance? (big cap because im sure most of the slowness is on the internet side)

## requirements
- rust
- a discord bot

## note
this rewrite is probably gonna take a while as i have to learn the language and it's quirks at the same time.

## running
during the first launch of the program it will create a `config.toml` file, do make sure to fill it out.
```
cargo run
```
